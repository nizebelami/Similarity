I put as my first answer "La r√®gle du TRI ne permet pas de conclure pour ce projet" and it told me it was incorrect.

So, I put then  "Au COC de 5%, le projet est rentable pour l'entreprise" as my second attempt and it gave me error another time.

When I clicked upon "Show Answer" the computer gave me the two ones as correct with both ticks. 

Which one was the correct one? 

I have missed a point due to this system error, so I hope it won't happen during the Quiz evaluatif. 

Kind regards,

Matteo
